# SQL Challenge
### Contributor: Lan "Alice" Nguyen

This challenge was broken down into three key parts: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis.

### Data Modelling:
I inspected the six CSV files, and sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables.

### Data Engineering:
I used the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files, then imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

### Data Analyst:
I created these following tables:
- 1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
- 2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
- 3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
- 4. List the department number for each employee along with that employee's employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- 5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
- 6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
- 7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- 8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names.
